# Beecrowd problems

In order to keep practicing Python each day, I'm creating this repository to solve some problems from beecrowd website (formerly known as URI Online Judge). This is also a way to keep track of my progress. 

And here is a little quote that I like...

> "I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain." (Litany Against Fear)
